Hey everyone, decided to update our discord. The idea of starting a channel/team has been floating around for awhile. Basically what the vision is to have an active YouTube and Twitch of a team created by us. I just kinda gave our selves the name 'Sync' to start with but we can talk about the name later. Something that might interest people is have a competitive RB6 Siege team via GameBattle.net. Gamebattles used to be the biggest supporter of MLG but kinda died out. Still would be fun to play competitivly and once we get good at the game, we can play for small cash prizes. LMK what you guys think of everything and open to suggestions. Thanks
